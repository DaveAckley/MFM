Fri Jul 26 11:08:43 2019 OK so lockstat.c shows how we can try for
locks and get them or not and so forth.  Let's go for an
'intrapreneurial spike' that gets code like that running in mfmt2,
just for testing and stats counting.  Just make a whole new foggen
interface based on what the hw locks are ready to provide, and we'll
impedance-match that to T2LongLivedLock, or whatever, later.

So.  ITCLocks.[hc] perhaps.  Plural because you go for locksets in
parallel.  Or maybe ITCLockset.[hc]?  Of course lockset isn't much of
a word so there's LockSet capitalization risk in the naming.  ITCLocks
it is.  (Despite the IT-Clocks parse risk that carries.)

Fri Jul 26 11:47:10 2019 OK have an early cut at ITCLocks.[hc], but
taking a nap here while mfmt2 is building itself pitifully slowly.
Issues on the table:

 - How to hook into the event loop, like in
   EventWindow::AcquireAllLocks or something?

 - How to let upper levels know which itcs are connected, so they can
   distinguish unneeded locks from failures?

Sat Jul 27 09:34:00 2019 OK well it's time to pack up and head for
England.  Going to take the keymaster and two other tiles to be 'the
grid'..  But for now:

BITS OFF.

Wed Aug  7 08:15:53 2019 OK so we're back.  How can we proceed on
real-hardware-integration?  REVIEW STATUS:

 - We have ITCLocks.cpp/h intended to manage ALL hardware ITC locks.
   It operates at the level of locksets and is not broken down to
   individual directions.

 - It has open/close for the device, and tryLock/freeLocks for
   locking, and, at the moment, fakeEvent() to try grabbing a random
   legitimate set of locks.

 - Can we add like 'u8 getReadySet()' to return a lockset
   corresponding to all ITCs that are usable?

 - Or maybe go higher level with like 'bool tryForLocks(C2D site)'
   that figures out the lockset itself?  It would need at least the
   tile w,h also, if we want to avoid templating all this currently
   non-templated stuff.

Wed Aug  7 13:34:28 2019 Well, every time I try to come at it from the
EventWindow.tcc side, I get all messed up and confused.  So let's just
keep growing from the bottom and see where we get.  

'bool tryForLocks(C2D site, C2D tileSize)' ?  Get all needed (if any)
and return true, or release any taken and return false.

Fri Aug  9 13:58:05 2019 OK, fakeEvent() is getting slightly realer
and it's time to move the flag for the weekend.

BITS OFF
