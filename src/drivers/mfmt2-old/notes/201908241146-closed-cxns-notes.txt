Sat Aug 24 11:48:23 2019 OK, so we have intertile "working" on full
loopback, but if any ITC isn't all hooked up and happy, we get wedged
in, apparently, a variety of ways.

So here to assess that situation.

Places to consider/examine/suspect:

 - Determining whether an ITC is open or not, even in the simplest
   case when it hasn't been connected since say reboot.

 - Needing some kind of timeout while waiting for cache update
   responses.

 - Needing some kind of timeout after giving a lock.

Sat Aug 24 11:53:14 2019 Let's consider the first.  First, let's
rebuild with debugging, then watch what happens during an event that
wants to involve an unconnected edge.[2:

Sat Aug 24 13:02:01 2019 Well, we have a partial loopback, with NW/SE
unconnected, but things still seem to be 'working'.  That's the static
disconnect case; it's easy to believe real ITC will have all kinds of
mid-event timeouts and stuff..

Sat Aug 24 13:10:53 2019 Where is it, again, that the Tile goes ACTIVE
on its own, in the normal stream of events?[4:

Sat Aug 24 13:14:29 2019 Well it's kind of weird.  It's actually
ConsiderStateChange that does it.  Every Tile::Advance goes to
ConsiderStateChange.  There, if m_requestedState is ACTIVE, and all
CPs are IDLE, the Tile goes active.  Later, Tile::ForcePassive sets
the tile PASSIVE -- but DOES NOT change m_requestedSate at that time.
So then a future ConsiderStateChange will change it back to ACTIVE
when all the CPs are idle, and that keeps happening until the grid
level changes m_requestedState back to passive.
